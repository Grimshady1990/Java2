# CryptoPlatform  

I will use everything I have learned from my Java2 projects to build a crypto platform.  
This is a beginner learning project and not a real cryptocurrency program.  

---

## Prime Directive P1  

I will use a method similar to `firstNFibonacci`, but instead of Fibonacci calculations,  
it will add 10% to the index to create the next index, and so on.  

This will generate future projections, showing a **10% increase in profits each month**.

## DNA P2  

I will use the DNA program to store four-digit PIN numbers with simple encryption.  

When a user creates a PIN:  
- 10 random numbers will be added to the beginning and end.  
- The actual PIN will be placed in the middle at a **fixed index**.  
- A boolean method will check whether the entered PIN matches this **predetermined index**.

## Bank P3  

I will use the Bank program to **create new user accounts** that will manage:  
- User information  
- Deposits  
- Withdrawals  
- Swaps  

---

## StringMeth P4  

I will use the `equals` method to **determine if a username exists**.  
 

## Languages P7  

This program works similarly to **P6**, but it will store information about  
more nuanced cryptocurrency features such as:  
- **NFTs**
