// 🚀 Welcome to your interactive ATM Java coding practice! Follow the guided steps below to write your code from scratch.

// 🎯 Step 1: Define a public class for practicing ATM functionality
// ✅ Create a public class 
// ✅ Declare two static variables to store total money across all ATM instances and the number of ATM instances
// 💡 Hint: Static variables are shared among all instances of the class
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 2: Define instance variables for ATM instances
// ✅ Declare instance variables for the ATM's name and the amount of money it holds
// 💡 Hint: These variables will store information specific to each ATM instance
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 3: Create a constructor for initializing ATM instances
// ✅ Define a constructor that accepts two parameters: an amount of money and an ATM name
// ✅ Update the total money and the number of ATM instances when a new ATM is created
// 💡 Hint: Use `this` keyword to refer to instance variables
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 4: Implement a `toString` method to provide ATM instance information
// ✅ Create a `toString()` method that returns a formatted string with the ATM's name and the amount of money
// 💡 Hint: This method allows you to print detailed information about the ATM instance
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 5: Implement the `withdrawMoney` method
// ✅ Create a `withdrawMoney()` method that accepts an amount to withdraw
// ✅ Check if the ATM has enough money to complete the transaction
// ✅ Update both the ATM's balance and the total money accordingly
// 💡 Hint: Use conditional statements to check if withdrawal is possible
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 6: Implement the `depositMoney` method
// ✅ Create a `depositMoney()` method that accepts an amount to deposit
// ✅ Add the deposited amount to both the ATM's balance and the total money
// 💡 Hint: This method should update the ATM's balance and the global total money
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 7: Implement static methods to track ATM statistics
// ✅ Create a static method `averageMoney()` to calculate and print the average amount of money across all ATMs
// ✅ Create a static method `totalATMs()` to print the total number of ATM instances
// ✅ Create a static method `totalMoneyMeth()` to print the total amount of money across all ATMs
// 💡 Hint: Static methods operate on the class-level data (static variables)
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 8: Test the functionality of the ATM class in the `main` method
// ✅ Instantiate multiple ATM objects and perform operations such as withdrawals and deposits
// ✅ Print the results of static methods and individual ATM details
// 💡 Hint: Instantiate different ATM objects and perform actions like deposit and withdraw
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎉 Great job! Run your code and check if everything works as expected. Debug if needed!
