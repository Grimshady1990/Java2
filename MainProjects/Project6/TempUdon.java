// 🚀 Welcome to your interactive Udon Noodle coding practice! Follow the guided steps below to write your code from scratch.

// 🎯 Step 1: Define the `PracUdon` subclass
// ✅ Create a `PracUdon` class that extends the `PracNoodle` class to inherit its protected attributes
// ✅ Use `super()` in the constructor to call the parent constructor and initialize the specific noodle properties
// 💡 Hint: Use the `PracUdon` constructor to assign values specific to Udon noodle (e.g., length, width, shape, ingredients)
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 2: Override the `toString` method
// ✅ Override the `toString` method to return a custom string representation for the `PracUdon` object
// ✅ Include the length, width, shape, and ingredients of the Udon noodle in the string
// 💡 Hint: The `toString` method is used to customize how the object is displayed when printed

// 🎯 Step 3: Override the `getCookPrep` method
// ✅ Override the `getCookPrep` method to provide specific cooking instructions for Udon
// ✅ Customize the cooking steps, such as kneading, resting, rolling, and boiling the noodles
// 💡 Hint: The `getCookPrep` method is meant to provide the cooking instructions specific to Udon
