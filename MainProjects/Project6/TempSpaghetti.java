// 🚀 Welcome to your interactive Spaghetti Noodle coding practice! Follow the guided steps below to write your code from scratch.

// 🎯 Step 1: Define the `PracSpaghetti` subclass
// ✅ Create a `PracSpaghetti` class that extends the `PracNoodle` class to inherit its protected attributes
// ✅ Use `super()` in the constructor to call the parent constructor and initialize the specific noodle properties
// 💡 Hint: Use the `PracSpaghetti` constructor to assign values specific to Spaghetti noodle (e.g., length, width, shape, ingredients)

// 🎯 Step 2: Override the `toString` method
// ✅ Override the `toString` method to return a custom string representation for the `PracSpaghetti` object
// ✅ Include the length, width, shape, and ingredients of the Spaghetti noodle in the string
// 💡 Hint: The `toString` method is used to customize how the object is displayed when printed

// 🎯 Step 3: Override the `getCookPrep` method

// ✅ Customize the cooking steps, such as boiling spaghetti and adding sauce or cheese
// 💡 Hint: The `getCookPrep` method is meant to provide the cooking instructions specific to Spaghetti
