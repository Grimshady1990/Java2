// 🚀 Welcome to your interactive Ramen Noodle coding practice! Follow the guided steps below to write your code from scratch.

// 🎯 Step 1: Define the `PracRamen` subclass
// ✅ Create a `PracRamen` class that extends the `PracNoodle` class to inherit its protected attributes
// ✅ Use `super()` in the constructor to call the parent constructor and initialize the specific noodle properties
// 💡 Hint: Use the `PracRamen` constructor to assign values specific to Ramen noodle (e.g., length, width, shape, ingredients)

// 🎯 Step 2: Override the `toString` method

// ✅ Include the length, width, shape, and ingredients of the Ramen noodle in the string
// 💡 Hint: The `toString` method is used to customize how the object is displayed when printed
