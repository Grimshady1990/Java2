// 🚀 Welcome to your interactive Noodle Java coding practice! Follow the guided steps below to write your code from scratch.

// 🎯 Step 1: Define the `PracNoodle` class for noodle attributes and behaviors
// ✅ Create a `PracNoodle` class with protected instance variables for noodle length, width, shape, and ingredients
// ✅ Use the `this` keyword to assign values to these fields from the constructor parameters
// 💡 Hint: Protected variables can be accessed by subclasses due to inheritance
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 2: Create a method to describe noodle info
// ✅ Implement a method `getNoodleInfo` that returns a string with the noodle's name and ingredients
// 💡 Hint: This method will provide noodle-specific details for any noodle type
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 3: Create a method for cooking preparation
// ✅ Implement a `getCookPrep` method with a basic cooking instruction for noodles
// ✅ This method can be overridden by subclasses to provide specific cooking instructions for different noodle types
// 💡 Hint: The `getCookPrep` method is for common noodle preparation and can be customized in subclasses
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 4: Create subclasses for specific noodle types
// ✅ Create subclasses for each noodle type (e.g., Spaghetti, Ramen, Pho, Udon) that extend `PracNoodle`
// ✅ Override the `toString` method in each subclass to provide unique information for each noodle type
// 💡 Hint: Subclasses will inherit the properties and methods of `PracNoodle` and can override them as needed
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 5: Create an ArrayList to store instances of different noodle types
// ✅ Instantiate multiple noodle objects and add them to an `ArrayList`
// ✅ Loop through the `ArrayList` and call the `getCookPrep` method for each noodle object
// 💡 Hint: This allows you to demonstrate polymorphism, where the same method works differently for each subclass
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎯 Step 6: Print noodle specifications and flour type information
// ✅ Print details for each noodle object, using the `toString` method to display noodle specifications
// ✅ Use the `getNoodleInfo` method to display specific ingredients and noodle names
// 💡 Hint: This step will show how each subclass behaves based on the inherited `PracNoodle` class
// ✍️ Type your code below this comment


// 🎉 Great job! Run your code and check if everything works as expected. Debug if needed!
